##Analysis of TARGET-NBL dataset to study the functional relationship among miR-7, AMBRA1 
##and n-Myc in neuroblastoma
We downloaded the data of neuroblastoma samples collected in the TARGET-NBL dataset, accessible through the [NCI Genomic Data Commons Data Portal](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/). The TARGET initiative - where TARGET stands for 'Therapeutically Applicable Research To Generate Effective Treatments' - aims at investigating the genomics of childhood cancers.
